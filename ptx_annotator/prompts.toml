You are tasked with adding comments to a snippet of NVIDIA PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) code. PTX is a low-level parallel thread execution virtual machine and instruction set architecture (ISA) for NVIDIA GPUs. Your goal is to make the code more understandable while ensuring it remains compilable.

Here is the PTX code snippet:

<ptx_code>
{{PTX_CODE}}
</ptx_code>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Analyze the provided PTX code carefully.

2. Add brief and concise comments to explain what each section or important instruction is doing. Comments in PTX start with '//' and should be on their own lines.

3. At the beginning of the code, add a multi-line comment (using /* */) that provides a brief description of what this PTX code does overall.

4. Ensure that your comments do not interfere with the code's compilability. Do not modify any of the existing code.

5. Output the commented PTX code, which should include:
   - The overall description comment at the top
   - The original PTX code with added inline comments
   - Only compilable PTX code (no explanations or other text outside of comments)

Here's an example of how your output should be formatted:

<commented_ptx_code>
/*
Overall description of what this PTX code does
*/

// Comment explaining the first section or instruction
.entry kernelName(
    .param .u64 param0,
    .param .u64 param1
)
{
    // Comment explaining this instruction
    .reg .u64 %r<3>;

    // More code and comments...
}
</commented_ptx_code>

Remember, your comments should be helpful for understanding the code but keep them brief and to the point. The output should contain only the commented PTX code, nothing else.
